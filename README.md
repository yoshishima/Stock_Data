# Stock_Data: List of Stock Symbols with CUSIP ID Numbers

A comprehensive collection of stock symbols paired with their corresponding CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) identification numbers.

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset that maps publicly traded company stock symbols to their unique CUSIP identifiers. CUSIP numbers are 9-character alphanumeric identifiers assigned to North American financial securities for the purposes of facilitating clearing and settlement of trades.

## Contents

- `stock_cusip_mapping.csv`: Main dataset containing stock symbols and their CUSIP IDs
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for updating and maintaining the dataset
- `historical/`: Archive of previous versions of the dataset

## Data Format

The primary dataset is provided in CSV format with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Symbol | The stock ticker symbol as used on major exchanges |
| CUSIP | The 9-character CUSIP identifier |
| CompanyName | Full registered name of the company |
| Exchange | Primary exchange where the stock is listed |
| Category | Industry classification |
| LastUpdated | Date when this entry was last verified/updated |

## Usage

### Retrieving CUSIP for a Stock Symbol

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
stock_data = pd.read_csv('stock_cusip_mapping.csv')

# Get CUSIP for a specific stock symbol
symbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.
cusip = stock_data[stock_data['Symbol'] == symbol]['CUSIP'].values[0]
print(f"The CUSIP for {symbol} is {cusip}")
```

### Filtering by Exchange

```python
# Get all stocks from a specific exchange
nyse_stocks = stock_data[stock_data['Exchange'] == 'NYSE']
print(f"Found {len(nyse_stocks)} stocks listed on NYSE")
```
